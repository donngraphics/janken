This is my attempt at creating a Rock Paper Scissors game according to The Odin Project. I don't have high hopes for this.
So! With help from the wonderful people at The Odin Project forums, I was able to get the half of my code correct (I was invoking the computerPlay(); function twice). After getting that taken care of, I was able to work my way through getting the code to loop and play five rounds of rock paper scissors. I even accidently discovered how to loop my prompt; I was going to write a function, but I think I would have to rewite my entire code for that to work. I think I work best by writing my code bit by bit, in chunks. Get the code working by themselves, then bring them together with some tweaking. Codepen.io derserves a big shoutout, I was able to work there when I was away from my home station.
